# ‚úàÔ∏è **US Flights Dashboard ‚Äî 2015 Performance Analysis**

---

### üìå **Overview**

This project demonstrates my ability to build a professional **interactive dashboard** using **Power BI Desktop**. The goal was to analyze a large **US Flights dataset** for the year **2015**, identify patterns in airline performance, flight delays, and regional trends, and present these insights through a visually engaging **dark-themed neon dashboard**.

## üéØ **Purpose**

The dashboard answers:
